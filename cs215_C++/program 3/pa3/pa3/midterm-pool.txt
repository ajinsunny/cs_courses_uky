long@5@5@List at least two reasons to use a reference parameter. List at least one reason to use a value parameter.@You would use a reference parameter if you need to change the argument and have the change reflected in the caller (for example, if your function has more than one output, so the return value isn't sufficient), or if you need to get the argument itself instead of a copy of it (for example, in a copy constructor). You would use a value parameter in most other cases: in particular, if you need to modify the parameter but not change the original argument, you should use a value parameter. Also, if your function needs to accept a literal argument, it must use a value parameter, because references parameters only accept variables, not literals.
long@5@7@How are pointers and references similar? How are they different?@Pointers and references both allow creating an alias for another variable: a reference parameter is another name for the argument variable, while a pointer can point to a variable so that *p refers to the variable itself. However, references can be used directly the same as the original variable, while pointers require & to get a pointer to a variable and * to get the variable from a pointer. Furthermore, pointers can point to nothing (the NULL pointer), while references always refer to something.
long@5@9@What is the difference between an object and a class? Give at least three examples of each.@An object represents a thing, and can be stored in a variable. A class describes a set of objects with the same behavior: classes are the types to which objects belong. string, ifstream, and vector<int> are classes. cout, cin, and string name are objects.
long@6@6@Write a function that removes the first element from an array, keeping the order of the other elements.@void remove_first(int array[], int &size)@{@    // Move each subsequent element back by one position.
