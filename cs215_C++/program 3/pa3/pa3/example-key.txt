   Pointers and references both allow creating an alias for another variable: a
   reference parameter is another name for the argument variable, while a
   pointer can point to a variable so that *p refers to the variable itself.
   However, references can be used directly the same as the original variable,
   while pointers require & to get a pointer to a variable and * to get the
   variable from a pointer. Furthermore, pointers can point to nothing (the
   NULL pointer), while references always refer to something.
